Examples of Common Integration Patterns:
- Importing a library and calling its functions: Non-derivative work
- Copying and modifying library code: Derivative work
- Using library through API calls: Non-derivative work
- Extending library classes/interfaces: Derivative work

### Determining Derivative vs. Dependent Works

To determine whether your work is a Derivative Work or a Dependent Work, follow this decision tree:

1. Does your work modify the Software's Source Code?
   - Yes: It is a Derivative Work.
   - No: Proceed to question 2.

2. Does your work create a technical dependency on the Software (e.g., requiring additional code to compile or function)?
   - Yes: It is a Derivative Work.
   - No: Proceed to question 3.

3. Does your work integrate the Software's Source Code in a way that makes the integrated parts interdependent?
   - Yes: It is a Derivative Work.
   - No: Proceed to question 4.

4. Does your work use the Software as is, without modification, and interact with it solely through standard protocols, operating system interfaces, or linking?
   - Yes: It is a Dependent Work.
   - No: Consult the full definitions in Section 1.4 for further clarification.
