# AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License (AOCL)

The text of the AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License itself is:
Copyright © 2025 Christian Lee Seibold. All rights reserved.

Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document. Modification of this license document is forbidden, as specified in Section 6 of this license.

The name "AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License™" may only be used to refer to this license and may not be used to refer to any modified version of this license or any other license.

## Preamble

The AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License (AOCL) is designed to provide a balanced approach to copyleft that ensures modifications to source code remain open while enabling flexible integration through linking interfaces, UIs, standard library usage, and data exchange.

AOCL protects the rights of creators through attribution requirements and patent provisions while addressing modern software delivery methods, including network services (e.g., SaaS).

By distinguishing between Derivative and Dependent works, the license balances copyleft with flexibility. Derivative works are subject to copyleft under the AOCL license, whereas Dependent Works can be licensed differently, subject only to attribution, trademark, and patent requirements, but not to copyleft. This allows AOCL-licensed Software to be used as a library for static linking, dynamic linking, FFI, or standard inclusion as a library without modification, which is common in programming languages like Rust and Golang.

Unlike other open source licenses, AOCL is a fixed version without automatic version upgrading, removing confusion about which version applies to a given software, whether derivatives can or cannot utilize "later versions" of this license, and ensuring all modifications to software under this license can be upstreamed without additional restrictions placed on those modifications.

This license represents a middle ground that is more protective than permissive licenses and more pragmatic than traditional strong copyleft licenses, allowing the software to be used in widely diverse contexts with appropriate attribution and patent protections, and maintaining a consistent set of obligations that cannot change over time without the explicit permission of the Original Authors or Copyright Holders of the software.

Recent events have highlighted how traditional open source licenses could be manipulated through creative interpretation to restrict redistribution and rebuilding rights - a practice intended to discriminate against particular persons, groups, and fields of endeavor. It represents a real threat to open source principles that risks reverting the ecosystem to an era without open source freedoms. AOCL explicitly closes this loophole by preventing any attempt to terminate, discourage, impede, or restrict rights when users exercise their open source freedoms. Simply redistributing and rebuilding code is part of the very purpose and spirit of open source, whether or not it adds value or modifies the code. While certain commercial entities that have built their businesses on the backs of the open source community may find this inconvenient for their "enterprise" business models, we believe that when software is open source, it should remain genuinely open source, not merely open source in name only.

## License Terms

### 1. Definitions

1.1 "This License" refers to AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License (AOCL).

1.2 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

1.3 **"The Software"** refers to the original work of authorship in any form (including both Source Code and binary forms), including any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works thereof, that is distributed under this license.

For clarity, the term "the Software" by itself refers specifically to the work licensed under this license, and does not include other programs that use, interact with, or incorporate the Software through methods described as exclusions in Section 1.6, though such programs remain subject to specific provisions of this license as explicitly stated herein.

1.4 **"You"** refers to the individual or entity exercising the rights granted under this license. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

1.5 **"Source Code"** refers to the preferred form of the Software for making modifications to it.

1.6 Definitions of Software Interaction and Modification

   a) Contains, is based on, or is derived from the Software through Modification, Enhancement, or Addition; or
   b) Incorporates any part of the Software's source code with modifications; or
   c) Would require permission under copyright law from the Original Authors or Copyright Holders due to modification or adaptation of the Software.

1.8 "Dependent Work" means any work that, given the definitions in Section 1.6:
   a) Uses or Interacts with the Software without modification; or
   b) Incorporates the unmodified Software through compilation, linking, or other standard integration methods; or
   c) Relies on the Software's functionality through well-defined interfaces without modifying the Software itself.

   Such Dependent Works are subject to Sections 4 (Attribution), 5 (Trademark Usage), and 8 (Network Usage) of this license, while retaining their independence in other aspects.

1.9 The following are neither Derivative nor Dependent Works:

   a) Works that are separate and independent from the Software, where "independent" means capable of functioning without any reference to or reliance on the Software, including:
      - Works merely distributed alongside the Software
      - Works aggregated with the Software on storage or distribution media

   b) "Contributors": Any individual or entity that has submitted a Contribution that has been Released (as defined in Section 1.13). Contributors retain copyright to their Contributions while granting licenses as specified in Section 3.2, unless explicitly transferred to the Original Authors or Copyright Holders through written agreement.

   The terms "Original Authors" and "Copyright Holders" may be used interchangeably when referring to rights and obligations under this license, while "Contributors" specifically refers to those who have made Released Contributions as defined in Section 1.13.

1.12 **"Sublicense"** refers to the act of granting to others the rights you received under this license, but under different or additional terms than those contained in this license.

1.13 **"Contribution"** means any modification, enhancement, or addition to the Software that is intentionally submitted to the Original Authors or Copyright Holders for inclusion in the Software. A Contribution is "submitted" when provided through any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication, excluding communications explicitly marked as "Not a Contribution."

For purposes of revocation rights, a Contribution is considered "Released" when it has been publicly distributed as part of the Software, whether in Source Code or binary form, through any channel including but not limited to official releases, public repositories, or distribution platforms.

1.14 **"Trademarks"** refers to any names, marks, logos, icons, designs, or other designation used by the Original Authors or Copyright Holders to identify themselves, their projects, or the Software.

1.15 **"Rebuild"** means the process of compiling or assembling the Software from its Source Code or other intermediate forms into its final executable or deployable form.

### 2. Grant of Rights

2.1 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
