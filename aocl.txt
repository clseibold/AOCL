# AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License (AOCL)

## Preamble

The AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License (AOCL) is designed to enliven an ecosystem where software freedom and practical usability coexist. This license embraces a balanced approach to copyleft, ensuring that modifications to source code remain open while enabling flexible integration through linking interfaces, GUIs, and data exchange.

AOCL protects the rights of creators through attribution requirements and patent provisions while addressing modern software delivery methods, including network services (e.g., SaaS). By distinguishing between Derivative and Dependent works, the license balances legal certainty and flexibility.

Unlike other open source licenses, AOCL is a fixed version without automatic version upgrading, removing confusion about which version applies to a given software, whether derivatives can or cannot utilize "later versions" of this license, and ensuring all modifications to software under this license can be upstreamed without additional restrictions placed on those modifications.

This license represents a middle ground that is more protective than permissive licenses and more pragmatic than traditional strong copyleft licenses, allowing the software to be used in widely diverse contexts with appropriate attribution and patent protections, and maintaining a consistent set of obligations that cannot change over time without the explicit permission of the original authors or copyright holders of the software. By choosing this license, you contribute to a collaborative ecosystem that balances freedom, recognition, and practical adoption.

## License Terms

### 1. Definitions

1.1 **"Software"** refers to the original work of authorship in any form (including both Source Code and binary forms), including any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works thereof, that is distributed under this license.

For clarity, the term "Software" by itself refers specifically to the work licensed under this license, and does not include other programs that merely link to, interact with, or incorporate the Software through methods described as exclusions in Section 1.4, though such programs remain subject to specific provisions of this license as explicitly stated herein.

1.2 **"You"** refers to the individual or entity exercising the rights granted under this license.

1.3 **"Source Code"** refers to the preferred form of the Software for making modifications.

1.4 Derived and Dependent Works:
   a) **"Derivative Work"** refers to any work that incorporates, adapts, or modifies the Software's Source Code in any of the following ways:
      - Any modification to the Software's Source Code or binary form, whether or not the modification creates new dependencies
      - Changes that create a technical dependency, where a "technical dependency" exists when:
         * The modified Software requires additional code to compile or function that was not required by the original Software
         * The Software cannot operate without this newly required code
         * The dependency requirement was introduced through modifications to the Software's Source Code
      - Integration of the Software's Source Code with other code in a way that makes the integrated parts interdependent
      - Ports, transpilations, or translations of the Software into other programming languages or formats.
      - Incorporation of significant portions of the Software's Source Code

   b) **"Dependent Work"**, for the purposes of this license, refers to any software that uses or interacts with the Software without qualifying as a Derivative Work, including but not limited to:
      - User interfaces that display output from or provide input to the Software without reproducing the Software's Source Code.
      - Independent programs that communicate with the Software solely through:
        * Standard protocols and inter-process communication
        * Operating system interfaces, including launching, invoking, or executing the Software as a separate process
        * Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI)
        * Static or dynamic linking
      - Independent works that use the Software as a dependency without modification, even if the full Source Code is integrated into the Work's binary.
      - Works that use the Software as a tool without incorporating its Source Code
      - Container images that include unmodified copies of the Software

     Such Dependent Works are subject to Sections 4 (Attribution), 5 (Trademark Usage), 7.1(b) (Patent Grant), and 8 (Network Usage) of this license, while retaining their independence in other aspects.

1.5 **"Prominent Notice"** refers to a notification that would be discoverable by an ordinary user during normal use of the software, including but not limited to placement in:
   a) "About" screens, help menus, or settings pages in graphical applications
   b) Startup messages, help output, or standard documentation in command-line applications
   c) API documentation, README files, or developer guides for libraries
   d) Footers, "About" pages, or terms of service for web applications
   e) Installation processes, documentation, or license files for all software

1.6 **"Original Authors or Copyright Holders"** refers to the individuals or entities who own the copyright to the Software, including the initial creators and any subsequent owners who have legally acquired the copyright through assignment, transfer, inheritance, or other legal means.

1.7 "Sublicense" refers to the act of granting to others the rights you received under this license, but under different or additional terms than those contained in this license.

1.8 **"Contribution"** means any modification, enhancement, or addition to the Software that is intentionally submitted to the Original Authors or Copyright Holders for inclusion in the Software. A Contribution is "submitted" when provided through any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication, excluding communications explicitly marked as "Not a Contribution."

For purposes of revocation rights, a Contribution is considered "Released" when it has been publicly distributed as part of the Software, whether in Source Code or binary form, through any channel including but not limited to official releases, public repositories, or distribution platforms.

1.9 **"Trademarks"** refers to any names, marks, logos, icons, designs, or other designation used by the Original Authors or Copyright Holders to identify themselves, their projects, or the Software.

### 2. Grant of Rights

2.1 You are granted the right to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software, but not sublicense it or impose additional restrictions, provided that:

   a) For Derivative Works and direct copies of the Software:
      - A complete copy of this license must be included.
      - A prominent notice stating that the Software is licensed under the AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License must be included.

   b) For Dependent Works that use the Software, as per the exclusions in Section 1.4(b):
      - A copy of Sections 4, 5, 7.1, 7.2, and 8 of this license, or a reference to this license in full, must be included.
      - A prominent notice stating that the software incorporates elements covered by the AuraGem Opensource Copyleft License must be included.
      - A reference to where the Software's Source Code can be obtained must be included.
      - Any use of Trademarks must comply with Section 5 of this license.

   c) Any distribution you make must be made directly under the terms of this license without sublicensing. Each recipient receives their rights directly from the Original Authors or Copyright Holders, not from you as an intermediary.

### 3. Copyleft

3.1 Any Derivative Works of the Software must be licensed under the same terms as this license. You may not impose any additional restrictions on the rights granted by this license, nor may you sublicense the Software or any Derivative Works. Incorporating or embedding the Software's Source Code directly into another codebase creates a Derivative Work subject to this provision.

3.2 Any Contributions intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Software shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as this license, without any additional terms or conditions.

3.3 By submitting a Contribution, you confirm that you have the legal right to do so and agree that your Contribution is automatically licensed under this license. The patent licenses granted in Section 7.1 apply to your Contribution when used alone or in combination with the Software.

3.4 Right to Revoke Unreleased Contributions: You may revoke your Contribution at any time before it is Released (as defined in Section 1.8) by providing clear notice to the Original Authors or Copyright Holders through the same channel used for the original submission or through direct communication. Upon such revocation, the license grants in this license with respect to that specific unreleased Contribution are terminated. Once a Contribution has been Released as part of the Software, the license grants become irrevocable.

### 4. Attribution Notices

4.1 You must preserve all attribution notices and copyright statements included in the Software. These notices must be retained in all copies of the Software, any Derivative Works, and any Dependent Works that use the Software as described in Section 1.4(b).

4.2 If you modify the Software, you must include a prominent notice stating that you have changed the Software and the date of such changes.

4.3 Attribution Display Requirements:
   a) For graphical user interfaces: If the Software displays attribution notices in a graphical user interface, software that also includes a graphical user interface must display equivalent attribution notices in a reasonably similar location and manner.
   b) For command-line interfaces: If the Software displays attribution notices in command-line output, software that also includes a command-line interface must display equivalent attribution notices in a reasonably similar manner.
   c) For documentation: Attribution notices must be preserved in all documentation related to the Software or Derivative Works.

4.4 Use of names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Original Authors or Copyright Holders is governed by Section 5 (Trademark Usage), with limited permissions for attribution purposes as specified in Section 5.2.

4.5 Scope of Attribution Requirements:
   a) The attribution requirements in this section (Section 4) apply to all software that uses the Software or its Source Code in any way, even if that software is not considered a Derivative Work under Section 1.4.
   b) This means that even software that merely links to the Software, provides a user interface for the Software, or communicates with the Software through APIs must comply with all attribution requirements in Section 4.
   c) These attribution requirements are independent of the obligation to share source code, which applies only to Derivative Works as defined in Section 1.4.

### 5. Trademark Usage

5.1 This license does not grant you any right to use any Trademarks in the following ways:
   a) To identify any software other than the unmodified Software;
   b) In any manner that might cause confusion about the origin or ownership of the Software;
